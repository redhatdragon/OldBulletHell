BEFORE YOU EDIT/COMPILE
Ask dmz for instructions on how to install gcc
as you'll likely need help setting up pathing
to the compiler.  Also this is 32 bit gcc.

WHAT IS GCC?
A general c compiler that'll rock your world!
It handles a variaty of languages if set up
correctly but is cross compilable and cross
platform.  It's biggest bonus is the ability
to mix c, c++, and assembly easily and locally.
None of that dependency bullshit form visual
studio.  BYE-BYE Microsoft stupidity.

DMZ is the main folder which is the domain of dmz.
If you wish to make an edit just copy the contents
of the DMZ folder and paste it in a folder with
your name and recommend DMZ to look at it.  Don't
worry whatever changes you made will be looked at
and taken into consideration for the main copy.

Don't worry everything is locally scoped.
