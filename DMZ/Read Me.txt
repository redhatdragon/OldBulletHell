BEFORE YOU EDIT/COMPILE
Ask dmz for instructions on how to install gcc
as you'll likely need help setting up pathing
to the compiler.  Also this is 32 bit gcc.
If you already know how to do this or have done
so already then i tip my hat to you.

WHAT IS GCC?
A general c compiler that'll rock your world!
It handles a variaty of languages if set up
correctly but is cross compilable and cross
platform.  It's biggest bonus is the ability
to mix c, c++, and assembly easily and locally.
None of that dependency bullshit from visual
studio.  BYE-BYE Microsoft stupidity.

If you wish to make an edit to the code that's
someone elses responsibility either ask them
before hand or copy everything from the DMZ
folder into another with your name on it THEN
edit what you want.  This prevents github
from complaining and preventing us from pushing;
pulling new content.

Don't worry everything is locally scoped.

If your a level editor you need to coordinate
with whoever else is editing the level.  Otherwise
don't worry because anything you do won't effect the
programmers and vice versa.  Just as long as all the
"level->spawnActor(*new blablabla)" is inside a txt
file sitting inside the SpawnList folder.

In honesty since we are such a small group i wonder how
many people will actually read this?lol
